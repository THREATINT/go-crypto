## Introduction
If you need basic cryptographic functions to secure data from within your application, but have no clue about the details of cryptography, this library is for you!
You don't want your code to contain a lot of lines of code that handle weird object types and strange APIs that have nothing to do with your actual business logic?
This library aims to be taking care about all details without messing up your code and without requiring you to be a guru in cryptography or computer science in general.
This first version supports only a few cryptographic hash functions and will be extended over time.

### Hashing
    - MD5 
    - SHA1
    - SHA256
    - SHA384
    - SHA512
    - RIPEMD160
